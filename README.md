# rpi-jingles
A Raspberry Pi radio / theatre cartwall to play jingles or sound FX instantly using a touch screen.
# What it does
Cartwalls are used in radio studios to play in jingles at the touch of a button. This is designed to do the same on a bog-standard Raspberry Pi connected to a touch screen. It does not require ANY other software or libraries to be installed, all you need is a Raspberry Pi with Raspbian installed, some WAV files in your Pi's defualt Music folder - and a touch screen for full effect. It could be used in student, hospital or community radio or for playing sound effects in a play.
